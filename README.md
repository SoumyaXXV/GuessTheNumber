## GuessTheNumber :-
The Java program is a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has five attempts to guess the correct number. The game utilizes a while loop to repeatedly prompt the player for guesses and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. If the player correctly guesses the number within the allotted attempts, they win; otherwise, the program reveals the correct answer, and the player loses. This program is a basic example of user input, random number generation, and conditional statements in Java, making it a fun and educational exercise for learning the language.
